# Getting Started with Three.js

Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library that makes it easy to create 3D graphics in the browser. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of Three.js and how to get started with your first 3D project.

## What is Three.js?

Three.js is a JavaScript library that provides a simple API for creating 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It handles many of the complex aspects of 3D graphics programming, making it accessible to web developers.

## Setting Up Your Project

First, let's set up a basic project structure:

```bash
mkdir threejs-project
cd threejs-project
npm init -y
npm install three
```

## Creating Your First Scene

Here's a basic example of creating a 3D scene with Three.js:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Create a scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// Create a camera
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 5;

// Create a renderer
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create a cube
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

// Animation loop
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

## Understanding the Core Concepts

### 1. Scene
The scene is where all your 3D objects live. It's like a container for your 3D world.

### 2. Camera
The camera determines what you see in your scene. There are different types of cameras:
- PerspectiveCamera (most common)
- OrthographicCamera

### 3. Renderer
The renderer is responsible for drawing your scene to the screen. WebGLRenderer is the most common choice.

### 4. Geometry
Geometry defines the shape of your 3D objects. Some common geometries include:
- BoxGeometry
- SphereGeometry
- CylinderGeometry

### 5. Material
Materials define how your objects look. Some common materials include:
- MeshBasicMaterial
- MeshPhongMaterial
- MeshStandardMaterial

## Adding Lights

To make your scene more realistic, you'll need to add lights:

```javascript
// Add ambient light
const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.5);
scene.add(ambientLight);

// Add directional light
const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.5);
directionalLight.position.set(1, 1, 1);
scene.add(directionalLight);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use BufferGeometry instead of Geometry
   - Implement level of detail (LOD)
   - Use texture atlases
   - Implement frustum culling

2. **Code Organization**
   - Keep your code modular
   - Use classes for complex objects
   - Implement proper cleanup

3. **Debugging**
   - Use the Three.js Inspector
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Use console logging strategically

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, you can explore more advanced topics:
- Loading 3D models
- Implementing physics
- Creating particle systems
- Working with shaders

## Conclusion

Three.js provides a powerful and accessible way to create 3D graphics in the browser. With its comprehensive API and active community, it's an excellent choice for web-based 3D applications.

> Pro Tip: Start with simple projects and gradually add complexity. The Three.js documentation and examples are excellent resources for learning.
